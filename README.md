# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-ggplot2
For this project, credit card transactions are analyzed to extract insights on tourists' spending patterns during a specific period of time. The goal is to discover different insights from the data through data visualization (with GGPlot2) and then transform them into potential business outcomes. Some of the questions that will be answered are: 1. Is there a particular time in which tourists are buying? 2. Which business category do tourist spend most on? 3. Which nationality has the highest average ticket and why? 4. Which nationality has the highest expenditure volumes? 5. Do high end fashion retailers need to focus more on attracting visitors of a specific set of nationalities? Why?
